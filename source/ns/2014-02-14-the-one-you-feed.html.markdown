Life lessons from a kitchen wall in Reykjavik:

An elderly Cherokee was teaching his grandchildren about life...

He said to them, "A fight is going on inside me, it's a terrible fight between two wolves."  

"One wolf is evil, he is fear, anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self pity, guilt, resentment, lies, inferiority, false pride, competition, superiority, and ego."

"The other one is good, he is joy, peace, love, hope, sharing, serenity, truth, humility, kindness, benevolence, friendship, empathy, generosity, compassion, and faith."

"This same fight is inside you, and inside ever other person too."

They thought about it for a minute, then one of the children asked, "Which one will win?"

The old Cherokee replied, "The one you feed."
