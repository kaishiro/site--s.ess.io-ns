I am often confused for a local here.  This is a new experience for me.  Having traveled almost predominantly to southeast Asia, often to areas removed from regular travel, I'm used to being the odd man out - the one white face in the crowd.

Here though, I'm just another Icelander.  People ask me for help fixing their cars - for directions.  They want to know what I'm studying at the University, or if I plan to go abroad after I've graduated.  They ask me all of these things in Icelandic.

I sometimes try and make out what's being asked of me, such as holding down a clamp under the hood of a sedan, but it's typically only after I disappoint them that I find out what's actually being said.

It's cute, and I suppose there should be some comfort in being able to travel inconspicuously.  But I guess the vanity in me misses being noticed - being special - if only because of how I look.
