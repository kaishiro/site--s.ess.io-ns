I am often confused for a local here. This is a new experience for me.  Having spent most of my time abroad in southeast Asia, I'm used to being the odd man out - the one white face in the crowd.

Here though, I'm just another Icelander. People ask me for help fixing their cars - for directions. They want to know what I'm studying at the University, or if I plan to go abroad after I've graduated. They ask me all these things in Icelandic.

I sometimes try and make out what they want.  With he hood open, it's easy to figure out someone needs an extra set of hands with their car.  But most of the time it's only after I disappoint them that I get the rest of the details.

It's cute, and I suppose there should be some comfort in being able to masquerade as a local. But I guess the vanity in me misses people noticing - if only because of how I look.
