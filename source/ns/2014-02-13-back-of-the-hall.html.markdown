This is Jesus.  He lives in the back corner of the Church of Hallgrimur.  According to Birna, a local record-keeper at the church, for a long while Jesus was on his way out.
                                                                                
Jesus' slow retreat began at the behest of the previous Bishop.  He was unhappy and unconvinced of the statues' likeness, and wanted it gone.  Over the course of the Bishop's tenure, the statue would make its way from a place of honor beside the pulpit to the back of the great hall.
                                                                                
Lucky for Jesus, the Bishop passed before the statue could receive its final shove.  He now stands, somewhat lonely, in the back corner of the Church of Hallgrimur.
