I always try to find at least one place to become a regular at while traveling.  In Iceland, I suppose it's Tiu Dropar.

It's small, maybe 25 seats.  Set below street level, it would be easy to miss if you weren't looking for it.  I suppose it feels like a small cafe you might find in Paris - at least it's adorned as such.  But having never been to France I'd be careful to make such a claim. We happened upon it by chance, and I've spent at least a small part of each day here since.

The morning waitress, Bego (short for Begona, and immediately mistaken for Bagel) is from Spain.  She's been in Reykjavik for for the better part of three years, and seems anxious to prove it. To that end, she was kind enough (one might even say thrilled) to draw me a crude estimation of my walk yesterday.  It seems in fact, had I continued on past the sign giving Esja its name, I would have ended up at a lighthouse. As well as being one of her favorite places, Bego informed me that sometimes there is a man with a dog outside who will bring you upstairs.

Bego and I are both unsure what actual relation this man has to the lighthouse, but tomorrow I intend to find out.
