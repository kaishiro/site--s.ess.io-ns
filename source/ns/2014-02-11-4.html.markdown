Reykjavik, as a rule it seems, is a remarkably easy city to work in as a developer.  It seems every other storefront is a cafe, or bar, or a cafe/bar.  There seems to be some approximation or wi-fi most places in the city, and you're rarely being rushed out for a turnover.

On top of all that, places just rarely seem full.  I'm sure it's at least partially related to the time of year, but I have yet to wait for a table anywhere.

I'm curious to see what changes the weekend will bring.
