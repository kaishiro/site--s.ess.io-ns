I'm firmly convinced that you can't know a city until you walk it.  Taxis will always get you where you need to go, but only by walking have I found the places that I can make my own.

This morning I woke, showered, and traded the warm dark of our basement apartment for the cold dark of a Reykjavik morning in February.  I had intentions of visiting the waterfront - and arriving there was presented with the above.  It seemed fake.  In the dim morning light, it was some remarkable backdrop dully painted into the hazy sky.

I walked west for a while.  No particular reason - it was just one of two choices.  I eventually happened upon a small map which gave this piece of land a name.  Esja.

It reminded me of how unprepared I was coming here.  All of my previous trips have always been prefaced with a period of understanding - language, culture, location.  This time though - I just left.

Maybe it's because it's one of the few countries I've visited where I knew the vast majority of the population would speak English.  Or maybe it's because my job didn't depend on it.  But until this morning, I hadn't even looked at a map.

I honestly don't know which I prefer.
