I'm convinced that you can't know a city until you walk it. Taxis will always get you where you need to go, but only by walking have I found the places that I can make my own.

I woke this morning, trading the warm dark of our basement apartment for the cold dark of a Reykjavik morning in February. I had intentions of visiting the waterfront - and arriving there saw the above. It seemed fake. In the dim morning light, it was some remarkable backdrop painted into the hazy sky.

I walked west for a while. No particular reason - it was just one of two choices.  Some time later, I happened upon a small map which gave this piece of land a name. Esja.

It reminded me of how unprepared I was coming here. All my previous trips have always began with a period of learning - language, culture, location. This time though - I just left.

Maybe it's because it's one of the few countries I've visited where I knew people would speak English. Or maybe it's because my job didn't depend on it. But until this morning, I hadn't even looked at a map.

I don't know which I prefer.
