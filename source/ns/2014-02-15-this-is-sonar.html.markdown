This is Sonar.

A drunken conversation turned reality.  A three night, 70 artist admixture of talent.

But let's take a step back.

This is Harpa.

Beginning in 2007, construction was halted for 7 months with the advent of the Icelandic financial crisis.  Finally completed in 2011, it's a stunning venue.  Four, in fact.  Unless you also count the third floor of the parking garage-cum-nightclub.  Converted specifically for this event, it's where Diplo and the rest of the proper DJ sect deliver - that puts us at five.

Inside Harpa - cold, hard stone.  Everywhere.  And a view out onto Reykjavik harbor from all sides.  Stunning.  Really.

I guess that brings us back to Sonar.

It's a pretty level field across the board.  It doesn't matter who you are, you get one hour.  Wow people.  Get them in the room.  Make them sweat.  That's your one job.

Most artists do it admirably.  The best leave you wondering where the *fuck* 60 minutes just went.

Some of the best stuff I saw was from bands I didn't even know enough to be disappointed by.

## Fura

Fura, a group with a frontwoman from an Icelandic fishing village of less that 700 dottirs and sons.  We chatted for a bit after the show and she's as gracious as she is humble.  It's clear she understands her trip to Harpa was a lot further than the 675 kilometers to Reykjavik harbor.

## Good Moon Deer

*Good Moon Deer* would have been my dark horse, had I known anything at all about them sitting down in Kaldalon to their show.  It was vivid.  Schizophrenic.  It didn't care.  Feel free to listen below, but I'm leaving this simply as a matter of record.  You won't get it.  I didn't either.  Neither do they.  But you might love it anyway.  I did.

## Muted

Muted dove head first into the Banksy/Shepard Fairey sub-culture - highlighting graffiti artists across the US during his set.  Halfway through, Vivid Brain, an Icelandic rapper, took a turn.  This is the break you don't look for, you just accept.  You can catch some tagging on the screen in the back.

## Tanya & Marlon

What I did not do was sit down to a *Tanya & Marlon* show.  SonarComplex, or Kaldalon, my favorite of the Sonar venues, was difficult to get into.  It was intimate - partially seated even.  On the carryover from Muted I decided it was more trouble to leave than stay.  Only a dozen people - actual fans - hung around.  By the time they finished their set, the handlers had given up trying to keep people back from the booth.  Tanya & Marlon seemed confused why they even tried to being with.

## Bonobo

Finally, *Bonobo* is the reason I'm sitting at a coffee shop in Reykjavik right now.  The reason six hours prior, I was freezing in the wind at the top of Mt. Esja.  Feeding bread to Icelandic ponies off Route 36.  Watching the afternoon sunset from Gulla's bohemian flat.

Music can be a powerful thing.  It can motivate you to leave - convince you to stay.  It got me to Iceland.

I'm greatful for that.
