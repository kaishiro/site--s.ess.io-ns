The darkness here really is stifling - or, at least, it would be - if that was the sort of thing to bother you.

I've always tended more towards mornings rather than evenings, and waking up early really is somewhat less rewarding when the earth can't even be bothered to greet you with a sunrise.

Yet despite our modernity, it feels as if people as a whole still live in a world without lights.  We can't help it.  Businesses are open, but Reykjavik still doesn't seem alive until dawn begins to break.  Even then, the city has only a few precious hours of industry until nature once again begins to dim the lights.

I suppose then, at the very least, nature gives recourse in its purveyance of the Northern Lights - the world's perverse consolation prize for an Icelandic climate.  But they *are* pretty.
