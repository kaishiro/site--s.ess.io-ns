Reykjavik, as a rule, is an effortless city to work in as a developer. It seems every other storefront is a cafe, or bar, or a cafe/bar. There has been some approximation of wi-fi most places in the city, and the waitstaff isn't in a rush to turnover a table.

On top of all that, places just rarely seem full. I'm sure it's owed to the time of year, but I have yet to wait for a table anywhere.

I'm curious to see what changes the weekend will bring.
